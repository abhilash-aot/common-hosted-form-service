## Alert Detail



### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Proxy Disclosure ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40025/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

1 proxy server(s) were detected or fingerprinted. This information helps a potential attacker to determine 
 - A list of targets for an attack against the application.
 - Potential vulnerabilities on the proxy servers that service the application.
 - The presence or absence of any proxy-based components that might cause attacks against the application to be detected, prevented, or mitigated. 

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-1136
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: `TRACE, OPTIONS methods with 'Max-Forwards' header. TRACK method.`
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Using the TRACE, OPTIONS, and TRACK methods, the following proxy servers have been identified between ZAP and the application/web server: 
- Unknown
The following web/application server has been identified: 
- [Express]
`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Disable the 'TRACE' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server.
Disable the 'OPTIONS' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server, if it is not required for other purposes, such as 'CORS' (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
Configure the web and application servers with custom error pages, to prevent 'fingerprintable' product-specific error pages being leaked to the user in the event of HTTP errors, such as 'TRACK' requests for non-existent pages.
Configure all proxies, application servers, and web servers to prevent disclosure of the technology and version information in the 'Server' and 'X-Powered-By' HTTP response headers.

### [ Permissions Policy Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10063/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.

### [ Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10035/)



##### Low (High)

### Description

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.

### [ Non-Storable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 4

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).
